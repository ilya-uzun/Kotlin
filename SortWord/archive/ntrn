Just finished 'Titanic'
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
I'm watching a video about the benefits of reading
Michelle
Michelle Gravois
I remember seeing it at the movies. 24 years ago üò≥
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
It's powerful, like the feeling when watching this movie
Michelle
Michelle Gravois
When you read you create your own world in your head which makes it powerful ü§ì
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
it's good, they say different things, I don't know why there are such videos. it is believed that reading is some kind of first-class hobby
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
Reading causes snobberyüòÖ
Michelle

So that's what happened to me üòÜ
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏

Michelle Gravois
By themselves?
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
Yes, they just came to the execution, I heard where that and took the children with them
Michelle
Oh, you mean to watch? I thought you meant the condemned went willingly üôÉ
Michelle
Michelle Gravois
People used to just make a casual day out of attending executions. It was very public
–í—ã –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏
now it is considered something wild
Michelle
This was supposed to be a deterrent
Michelle
I have read about all the mechanics of hanging. There is a formula for the length of the rope depending on the person's weight and the length of the drop ü§ì
Michelle
Michelle Gravois
Isn't this a lovely topic? üòÜ

And I've also read on all the studies through history on how long they believe a person to be conscious after having their head cut off

I think it's not like that at all, that's what the French thought, and that's why they raised the severed head and showed it to the crowd of onlookers
